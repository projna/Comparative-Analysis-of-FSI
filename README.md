# Comparative-Analysis-of-FSI

World hunger refers to areas where human population does not have adequate food on a regular basis. The "Zero Hunger" target of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) aims to eliminate hunger, enhance food security and nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. The UNSDGs are seen by both governments and Social Purpose Organizations (SPO) as galvanizing attention on the most pressing problems facing our society. The challenge with the adoption of SDGs by SPOs is that UNSDGs define country level goals and indicators, but SPOs operate at a local level. Consequently, the UNSDG indicators cannot be applied directly but have to be re-interpretated in the context of an SPO’s mission and local needs. Each SPO’s interpretation is unique, leading to a plethora of indicators with minimal overlap in their definition. Hence, it is impossible to benchmark the performance of SPOs when how they measure themselves differ. One would think that defining a common set of indicators would solve the problem, but there is a “culture of uniqueness” that pervades this sector that inhibits such a logical outcome.

The goal of this research is to develop an ontology-based method to comparatively analyze Canadian food security indicator definitions so that we can understand how similar they may be and what the sources of differences are. To achieve this goal, we developed an ontology for food security and an algorithm that used the food security ontology, combined with the ISO/IEC 21972 Indicator ontology (Fox, 2014; 2015; ISO/IEC, 2020), to compare the definitions of food security indicators. The algorithm extended the indicator consistency analysis work of Wang & Fox (2017) to identify differences based on causes other than consistency.
