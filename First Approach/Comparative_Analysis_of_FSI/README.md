# Comparative_Analysis_of_FSI

We attempted two approaches to conduct the comparative analysis. This is a first approach for comparative analysis of Food Security Indictors. Our first approach can compare axioms such as predicates and value restrictions. It initially imports and saves the information of the specified ontology in a file store before doing the comparison analysis. RDF triples are used to hold all indicator values, supporting data, and ontologies-based descriptions. As a result, axioms can reason about the names of each indication as input data. Property-wise comparisons seek for similarities between properties, whereas value-restricted comparisons compare the properties' values. Appendix 6 contains the outcome of the comparison analysis. We went through another alternative strategy to achieve a better comparable analysis because the approach was not promising to do a decent comparative analysis.
